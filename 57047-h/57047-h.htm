<h2><i>Drippings From the Fawcett</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Out on Rural Route No. 2 we haven’t much class,
as the saying goes, but we have a lot of fun. We
haven’t any bright lights, although the folks
about the country have thought so liberally of my little
bundle of bunk lately that I have been able to put in
a small farm lighting plant in the Whiz Bang house,
barn and yard.</p>

<p>Not many Minnesota farmers can afford, in these
low-wheat-price days, such a luxury as an electric lighting
plant, and so the one put in at the Whiz Bang farm
created quite an interest.</p>

<p>Gus, our hired man, thought it would be a good
idea to have a sort of celebration over the new electric
lights. The idea met with instant approval from Mrs.
Bill and the kids. The next question was how to celebrate
the great event. Gus suggested a “snoose”
party, but as not all of my neighbors chew the Copenhagen
breakfast food, his suggestion received a cool
reception, particularly from Mrs. Bill, who dislikes the
habit. It was left to my twelve-year-old daughter to
solve the problem, later in the day, when I discovered
her in the loft of the old red barn practicing toe dancing.
This suggested to my mind a dancing party.</p>

<p>And so we gave the party. I wired the hay loft
with electric lights and dumped a pail full of oatmeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
on the floor to make it slippery. We picked Gus as
the dance master, and here was his predominating
action for the evening:</p>

<div class="poetry-container sans">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">On a balmy night, when the weather’s clear,</div>
<div class="verse">The boys and girls from far and near;</div>
<div class="verse">We’ll congregate on the Whiz Bang farm,</div>
<div class="verse">To cut some capers in the old red barn.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">We have a drum and a jew’s harp, too,</div>
<div class="verse">Jim Moss plays on the tin bazoo;</div>
<div class="verse">And a fiddler over from Sugar Creek,—</div>
<div class="verse">Pick ’em up Silas and lay ’em down deep.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh, we’ll dance all night to the latest tune,</div>
<div class="verse">The Maiden’s Prayer or the old Hip Croon;</div>
<div class="verse">We’ll walk the dog and ball the jack,</div>
<div class="verse">And promenade around the old hay stack.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The horses nicker and the roosters crow,</div>
<div class="verse">Balance all and away you go;</div>
<div class="verse">Dance that one step nice and clean,</div>
<div class="verse">Possum trot and the lima bean.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now swing around like the old barn door,</div>
<div class="verse">If the music stops, then holler “more.”</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, pinch your gal on her rosy cheek,—</div>
<div class="verse">Pick ’em up Silas and lay ’em down deep.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Pick ’em up Silas and lay ’em down deep,</div>
<div class="verse">Ain’t no game of hide and seek,</div>
<div class="verse">Pick them knot holes from the floor,</div>
<div class="verse">Change your partners, forward four;</div>
<div class="verse">Hear the music to your feet,</div>
<div class="verse">Pick ’em up Silas and lay ’em down deep.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The only fault we had to find with Gus’ musical
attainments was that he didn’t say anything about the
dingbusted lighting plant going on the blink during
the dance. Something went wrong and the lights went
out, and when we came to again, I was horrified. Mrs.
Bill says we can’t give any more dances; not if those
girls from Sugar Creek are allowed to attend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Here it is Spring, the poets are with us and the
Thursday musicales can now render “The Coming
of Spring” by a scanty Aphrodite girlie in
true aesthetic rhythm, but I hearken naught to their
artificial atmosphere. I crave Mother Nature in all its
ruggedness.</p>

<p>Hence I have fared to my log cabin settlement on
the shores of Big Pelican lake in northern Minnesota,
accompanied by Mrs. Bill, the five kids, my dog Shep,
our new perfumed Persian pussy and, last but not least,
the good, old pedigreed bull, Pedro. Fred La Page,
my French-Canadian friend and the lord and master
of the Pequot settlement, threw in a couple of cows
in the deal wherein I acquired title to the cabins and
the shore property and advised me to bring the pedigreed
bull along to keep the cowlets company. And
so here we are at Pequot, and as I said before, it is
Spring and the birdies are singing in the treelets.</p>

<p>We’ve hardly been here a week when into our wild
and wooded midst enters, like an angel from Heaven,
a pretty young miss, a graduate of Minneapolis aristocracy
and unlearned in the ways of we simple country
folk. She had never seen a real pumpkin sprout in the
garden of nature and her knowledge of the products of
the soil was confined to what she had read in some
seminary institution.</p>

<p>The first evening, Gus, our hired man, picked some
of Brother La Page’s wild asparagus. We did it up in
butter, as was my wife’s custom, and served it in big
helpings on the old pine table.</p>

<p>Miss B⸺, our guest and new acquaintance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
was guided by etiquette and started to eat her asparagus
with a knife and fork, but Gus changed her mind.
Now Gus is a careless sort of fellow. When he surrounds
a plate of grub he is like time and tide. He
waits for no man. He simply surrounds his lips, arms,
fingers and what-not in mad haste to consume everything
on the table. He is oblivious to anything or anyone
else. So Gus grabbed the butt end of a big stock
of asparagus and sipped the tip of the vegetable in
much the same fashion as a steam suction hose cleaned
the streets of Paris in our soldier days. But Miss B⸺
was game. In manner demure, she nervously grasped
a luscious piece within her slender fingers. Blushingly,
she placed the tender morsel between her pearly
teeth. She was a game little girlie, despite her embarrassment.
The warm butter slobbered over her but, to
her credit, may it be said, she went through the ordeal
much like a seasoned veteran.</p>

<p>At this writing, I am glad to say, our angel is rapidly
becoming accustomed to backwood etiquette and
she now can eat away at any size asparagus just as well—well,
almost as efficiently as Gus. I said almost. It
would be impossible, I believe, to equal his record.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">At last, thank God, Mrs. Bill admits I have one
good quality—that of being tender-hearted. I
overheard her telling Gus that I was so tender
of heart that I wouldn’t kill a poor, defenseless fly, or
even beat a carpet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Pedro, famous pedigreed bull of the Whiz Bang
farm, has quite a reputation as a county fair prize
winner. Gus, the hired man, decided he’d make
a few extra dollars one week while I was “tooting it
up” in Minneapolis, so he started charging admission
to the many who came to view the noble animal.</p>

<p>A visitor approached Gus the first day of admission
charges and inquired as to the cost for himself,
wife and nine children, for viewing the bull.</p>

<p>“Not a cent,” promptly replied our faithful man.
“Come right in; I want Pedro to see you.”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">The girls of Texas, we judge from correspondents,
are madly in love with the confection known as
the lollypop or all-day sucker. We’ve received
several complaints from love-lorn swains requesting
that we ask the Texas girls to protect their tresses from
the sticky lollypops.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">So many Whiz Bang readers have requested that
we send them the automobile seat left on our farm
by a daring couple while they hiked to Robbinsdale,
to report the theft of their motor car, that we have
decided to retain it. An auto seat, you know, is valueless
without the car.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Gus is a progressive hired man. He progresses
from penny ante to nickel heart games to two-bit
moonshine. It’s a good thing he’s not very
strong for the ladies. He has plenty of bad habits now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Gus is a great fellow to play pranks. Whenever
he wants to chop wood around the smokehouse,
he goes to the farm house, opens the back door
and rings the dinner bell. All the flies swarm inside
and take their places in the dining room. Then Gus
closes the doors behind the flies and goes to the wood-pile
to work undisturbed. You have to hand it to Gus
for originality.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<h3>Spooky Stuff</h3>

<p>At a seance the other evening the spiritualists were
telling of their experiences with residents of other
worlds. One man told of conversing with a ghost,
another had dined with one. A woman declared she
had shaken hands with a departed friend, and others
followed suit until it seemed they had exhausted the
list of possible activities with spirits.</p>

<p>“We have heard the testimonials of the circle,”
said the medium, “but so far nobody has told of being
in love with a ghost. Is there anyone here who has had
that interesting experience? Has anyone ever loved a
ghost?”</p>

<p>“I have, lady,” said an Irishman in the rear of the
room.</p>

<p>“Step right up in front, I am sure everybody will
be interested in your experience,” said the medium.
“In all my life I’ve never heard of an instance of a
human loving a ghost.”</p>

<p>“Hell!” sputtered the Irishman, “I thought you
said a goat!”</p>

<h2><i>Sissified Flirts</i></h2>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Our Hollywood and Universal City writer is very
indignant this month. It appears he attended a movie
ball in Los Angeles and was pestered by divan dearies,
and so he shoots us a red-hot opinion of these sissies,
together with some spicy gossip of the dressing rooms.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="by">By RICHMOND</p>

<p class="dropcap">The male sissified flirt is becoming more and more
a social pest. One is liable to bump into this queer
creature at any social function, regardless of its
exclusiveness.</p>

<p>Let us dwell for a moment upon the great masque
ball recently held under auspices of theatrical people
at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. It is the
latest creation in behalf of the wealthy tourist who
visits Southern California.</p>

<p>In this huge pile, which somewhat resembles a
great depot, in depth of its long corridors and maze of
shops and stands, a scene of merriment occurred that
has not been rivalled in the history of winter tropics.</p>

<p>The affair was stopped, it is understood, by order
of the hotel management, when word freely was passed
that by some hook or crook booze was to be had on
an upper floor. Just how booze might get into a great
hotel and gradually cause the dance to become rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
flushed may have been a problem that puzzled and nettled
those responsible for the good name of the house
so far as Uncle Sam is concerned. At any event the
fiddlers left and the impression went about that the
hotel people weren’t going to stand for the party getting
rough.</p>

<p>Into the main dining-room, before the evening was
well started, two of our leading male comedians strode,
both with an ill-concealed bottle protruding from the
usual pocket. One of these comedians is a heavy gentleman
and a jolly one. The other is gaining fame as
a comedian because he never is known to smile.</p>

<p>Just what was in the bottles cannot be proved, but
the incident caused some words of criticism from other
members of the movie colony, who figured the boys
were “putting it on” a little too strong in view of the
assemblage present, ever ready to declare that the
“movies” are impossible.</p>

<p>But these two cheerful individuals, at the worst,
were only mistaken if they really intended to show
off or be funny or daring. Many a person present
would have been glad to join them, in consideration
of their hip pocket protrusion. Yet the occasion, the
time, the place, and so on, made it seem a bit garish.</p>

<p>But what about the rouge-soaked males in feminine
attire, and displaying toe to hip extremes, garbed
in lace tights, whose every movement, look and word
indicated absence of the masculine instinct as they
pranked and tripped about the ballroom floor, mingling
with dainty women and stalwart males who moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
uneasily away as the queer folk swung simpering and
smirking among them?</p>

<p>Take the two merry boys with the bottles in the
main dining-room, a little wild, perhaps, and making
somewhat of a show—but, withal, regular men taking
a lark as they found it—maybe somewhat “lit up,”
but exuding rough masculinity in their uncouth playfulness.
To be censured?</p>

<p>One regular he-man, or a party of them, invaded
under ordinary circumstances by queer-acting customers,
would make short shift of “sissy simps” and abide
by the consequences—there being small reason to fear
consequences. But a public gathering is different.</p>

<p>By the way, Mildred Harris (Charlie’s used-to-be)
led the Grand March with Earl Williams. It is remembered
that Williams recently, after his marriage, paid
a certain lady a sum (reputed to be $40,000) as a result
of a friendship which existed prior to the picture star’s
entrance into matrimony.</p>

<p>They are getting to be very businesslike, these
ladies. They give, but demand payment at times. But
if Earl Williams parted with $40,000, his partner in
the dance, fair Mildred, was rejoicing in a little sum
of $200,000 or so, which is the amount Charles is said
to have settled upon her when they parted at the ways.</p>

<p>Bookkeeping on the leaders of the Grand March,
it would appear that Earl and Mildred, between them,
were $160,000 ahead of the matrimonial deal, figuring
Earl’s loss of $40,000 and Mildred’s winnings of two
hundred grand.</p>

<p>Mary and Doug did not mingle with the ballroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
dancers to any extent. They are largely home folks
and only drop in on occasions at a party, and then
usually beat it in jigtime for the fireside.</p>

<p>One of our best-known young newspaper scribes
had half the house betting that he was dancing with
Edna Purviance, garbed in Turkish emblems. But
when she doffed her mask it was not Edna at all, but
a charming youngster of the pictures but not well
known to fame.</p>

<p>Since Edna has been resurrected in all her beauty
for Chaplin’s new picture, “The Kid,” the former
friendship between her and Chaplin has been rehashed
where the gossip-mongers meet for Wednesday night
meeting.</p>

<p>Another pleasing sight was the return of Lucille
Carlisle, until recently Larry Semon’s leading lady.
Rumor hath it that Lucille and Larry waged a young
war about something, as children will. But the soaring
young funny man of filmdom and his fair partner
were turtle doves who found no one to dance with but
themselves.</p>

<p>A false report went out that Bull Montana
attended the ball costumed like an ape. This is untrue,
for two reasons. One is that Bull wasn’t present, and
the other that he needs no costume when imitations
of a gorilla are in order. Bull’s face has become his
fortune and he is proud of it.</p>

a devil, and in his manhood, he is everything from a
lizard up. In his duties, he’s a damphool.</p>

<p>If he raises a family, he’s a chump. If he raises a
check, he’s a crook. If he is a poor man, he is a poor
manager and has no sense. If he is rich, he is dishonest
but considered smart. If he is in politics he is a
grafter and a thief. If he is out of politics, you cannot
place him as he is an undesirable citizen. If he donates
to foreign missions, he does it for show; if he doesn’t,
he is stingy and a tightwad.</p>

<p>When he comes into the world, they all want to
kiss him; before he leaves it, they all want to kick him.</p>

<p>If he dies young, there was a great future before
him. If he lives to a ripe, old age, he is only in the
way, just living to save funeral expenses. So Life is

<p><i>As full of dynamite and fusel oil as ever, Reverend
Morrill returns to Minnesota this month brimful
of information on the South and Central American
countries, which for the past three months he had
been touring for the Whiz Bang, and here’s his first
report. Incidentally, Reverend Morrill’s home in
Minneapolis is broken into by burglars nearly every
time he goes away on a Whiz Bang jaunt, and last
fall he lost $3,000 worth of choice red-eye. This last
trip he left a note: “Dear Boys: You won’t find any
booze or Liberty Bonds, but some good books, especially
this Bible, which says, ‘Thou shalt not steal.’
God forgive you—I do. G. L. Morrill.” Whether
or not the note was responsible is undetermined, but
nothing was missing this time.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="by">BY REV. “GOLIGHTLY” MORRILL</p>

<p class="center sans">Pastor People’s Church, Minneapolis, Minn.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="hide">“</span>Easy is the descent to hell”—except by way of
Venezuela, at whose ports of entry one suffers so
many inconveniences in the form of passport
visés, custom fees, red-tape, delay and insolence, that
if the Devil wishes to sustain his reputation of a conductor
of luxurious pleasure-tours to the infernal
regions, he should immediately get rid of his disagreeable
officials there. At La Guayra, custom authorities
rob the traveler of time, money and patience. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
sun-burnt bandits would steal the pennies from the
eyes of their dead father, and body-snatch their dead
grandmother to sell her entrails for sausage-casings.
The visitor should be on his guard, too, lest the city’s
dark-eyed daughters of delight steal away his heart.</p>

<p>La Guayra señoritas, like the scenery, are wild,
beautiful and romantic, though there are many wizened
witches, rheumatic, mustachioed and flea-bitten, who
make one sea-sick on land. The local enchantresses
give the stranger a good (bad) time—as well as a
choice assortment of undesirable souvenirs. It is a
pestiferous port where the laudable profession of
prostitution is much practised. These moral lepers are
much more dangerous than the physical ones in the big
asylum in the outskirts. Gay girls throw kisses to the
tenderfoot as he walks the streets—a most sanitary
and microbeless pastime.</p>

<p>Here I entered a girls’ school where the young
misses were learning much and not missing anything,
for as a practical object-lesson in physiology a naked
little boy had strolled in from the street and was roaming
about the room. Some of the citizens are quite
devout and show their gratitude to God for his numerous
blessings. I passed a saloon bearing the inscription,
“Gracios a Dios” (Thanks to God). Thus do the
simple-minded people obey the Scriptural command,
“In everything give thanks.”</p>

<p>A few minutes’ train ride takes you to Maiquitia,
where there is a popular shrine and a more popular
brewery. At the other end of the town lies Macuto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
where, if lucky, you may “clean up” yourself in a sea-bath,
or a pile of filthy lucre at the roulette table.</p>

<p>As our vessel steamed away from La Guayra, I
thought what a magnificent city it was—from the stern
of a ship.</p>

<p>In Valencia I read a placard in a church admonishing
the men not to wink at the girls during service.
The town had just been ravaged by a fever called
“Economica,” because it was said the people caught
it in the morning, languished in the afternoon and died
at night.</p>

<p>At the Hotel Los Baños, Puerto Cabello, one goes
in swimming <i>au naturel</i>. Many modest maidens are
only clad in a blush, making a <i>tableau vivant</i>. Verily,
as the guide-book saith, “The natural beauties of the
place are charming.” The harbor is deep; so is the
despair of the political prisoners who I saw working
in rags. One poor fellow was toiling away stark naked
among the breakers and sharp rocks. It is reported
that the victims are beaten in the early morning, during
the call of the reveille, to cover up their cries.</p>

<p>Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, lies at a 3,000-foot
“hell”evation above the sea. It is the “Paris of
South America” with its churches, parks, public buildings,
Pantheon, palace and promenades. The nerve-center
of the city is Plaza Bolivar, with an equestrian
statue of the hero who stood for liberty, and around
which congregate people who stand for everything.
Certain “Carac”teristics make this a viva “city” and
lubri “city.” The climate is cool, but tempered by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
“melting” glance of the <i>bonita muchachas</i>, whose
smiles would ripen peaches on a wall.</p>

<p>The dapper younkers of Caracas pursue their
studies at the University, and the señoritas on the
highway. Their “curriculum” also includes the race-track,
bull-ring, roulette-wheel (as omnipresent as the
Victoria coach-wheel), and art works, imported from
Paris and Barcelona, as vile and vivid as the paintings
of Parrhasius. Even picture portraits of Beethoven
and Wagner are made by grouping together nude portions
of female figures.</p>

<p>Lottery-tickets are not the only things sold in
town. Mothers come to the Plaza with their daughters
for sale. Wantons from the suburb lupanars solicit
under shadows of the trees, and their “Hist! hist!”
is as familiar as the sibilant call of the <i>filles publiques</i>
in Paris, who figure so frequently in the tales of
De Kock, Sue and Maupassant.</p>

<p>At “Madame Gaby’s” mansion of shame I found
a girl scarcely 12 years old. How shocking! But one
expects to be shocked in a city that is subject to earthquakes.
Not only pedestrians, but pederasts, i. e.,
“maricos” or “fairies,” haunt the streets and parks
of Caracas. Powdered and painted, they promenade
with mincing gait and ogling glance, marching to the
music of the band and making “overtures” to the
bystanders. The police know of this disgusting depravity,
and of the hordel resorts “for men only,” but
wink at it. This is as rank and rotten as anything I
ever saw in Algiers, or the Cairo “fish-market,”
where men were dressed as women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>In old Egypt the Temples of Isis were centers of
disgusting filth. In ancient Greece, even among her
greatest orators and philosophers, “Socratic love”
was proverbial and portrayed on the stage in the plays
of Aristophanes, although the Athenians officially punished
it with death. Livy, in his History of Rome,
castigates this heresy of love. The Ganymed pervert,
Geiton, is the hero of Petronius’ sinister novel,
“Satyricon.” Martial’s epigrams and Juvenal’s satires
flay this moral decadence. Out from Naples I visited
the island of Capri, where the Roman goat Emperor,
Tiberius, hired companies of catamites for his entertainment.
Domitan forbade the practice while Christianity
did much to suppress it. The student of history
knows the infamous lives of Russian rulers and of
Henry III, of France, in the seventeenth century. St.
Paul scored the Romans for this sin—what an epistle
could he indite against the Caracas “maricos” who
amuse, instead of disgust, the Caraquenians, who seem
to believe with Baudelaire that “<i>La Débauche et la
Mort sont deux amiables filles</i>” (Debauch and Death
are two amiable girls).</p>

<p>The worst spot in Venezuela is the despot dictator,
President Gomez. His authority is absolute, with the
accent on the “loot.” He takes what he wants; a
man’s personal property, wife or daughter. Dark
stories make him a modern Bluebeard. He is a moral
and physical leper. Rumor says that he sacrifices children
and drinks their blood to cure his maladies.
Gomez is the government; the legislative, executive
and judicial branches consisting of the cockpit, race-track<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and palace harem. He has panderers who scour
the country to procure beautiful women for him. His
personal and public character is so putrid, that many
of the inhabitants would like to elect him president of
a Guano island, with a salary in Guano. In the land
of Bolivar, the Liberator, Gomez muzzles the press,
suppresses free speech, maintains an army of spies,
and has imprisoned some of the best and brainiest men
of Venezuela in horrible dungeons for the crime of
loving liberty. The following would seem to be his
daily prayer:</p>

<div class="blockquote bold">

<p class="hanging">“My Father which art in Hell, powerful be
thy name.</p>

<p class="hanging">Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in Venezuela
as it is in Hell.</p>

<p class="hanging">Give me my daily bread, booze, and beef,
whether everybody else starves or not.</p>

<p class="hanging">And forgive me my debts, but not as I forgive
my debtors.</p>

<p class="hanging">And tempt me not into revolutions with my
neighbors, and deliver me from the evil
of any defeat; for thine and mine is the
kingdom, and the power, and glory, forever.
Amen.”</p>

</div>

<p>Coffee, cacao, cane, cattle, corn and illegitimate
children are the principal products of the country. At
one time the official census for three years in Caracas
gave legitimate births as 3,848, and illegitimate as
3,753. The ratio is even worse in the country districts.
A Venezuela bachelor who hasn’t a half-dozen mistresses,
has lost caste and is looked down on; a married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
man is expected to run two or three home establishments.
Love is free, but drugs are costly. A friend
of mine in the interior had a dear motherly lady come
to him and offer her three daughters for five dollars
a week.</p>

<p>’Tis said Alexander the Great wanted to destroy
the antique town of Lamsachus because of its Priapus
worship and obscene rites. Caracas was overturned
by an earthquake in 1812, when 12,000 people perished.
If that was a visitation of God’s wrath on account of
its wickedness, another punishment is due, for it is
in the class of the “Cities of the Plain”—</p>

<h3>Why Sergeants Are Liked</h3>

<p>For a miserable hour the new squad had been

remarked sweetly to the men:</p>

<p>“When I was a child I had a set of wooden soldiers.
There was a poor little boy in the neighborhood
and after I had been to Sunday school one day and
listened to a talk on the beauties of charity I was
softened enough to give them to him. Then I wanted
them back and cried, but my mother said:</p>

<p>“‘Don’t cry, Bertie, some day you will get your
wooden soldiers back.’</p>

<h3>Parley Vouz?</h3>

<p>Several officers were seated around the mess table
in France. One serious-minded major was in habit of
taking a French girl out to lunch two or three times
per week and taking a French lesson afterward.</p>

<p>“How much do you figure your French lessons
have cost you to date?” queried one of his companions,
winking around the board.</p>

<h3>Shocking!</h3>

<p>My brother Roscoe, who is a captain in the Air
Service, tells the following:</p>

<p>Officers in a garrison school were studying “Small
Problems for Infantry.” Turning to the large-sized
map on the wall, the major instructor called upon one
officer, Jones by name.</p>

<p>“Jones,” said he, “your battalion is camped here
at cross-roads 435 (indicating on map). It is enemy
country and you are told to cross this cornfield toward
farmhouse half-mile distant for the purpose of bringing
in the farmer or somebody who might furnish
information of the movements of the enemy. It is in
September, the corn is cut but not shocked, and as you
make your way across the field you suddenly ran into
two young ladies. What do you do?”</p>

<p>“I-I-I-I don’t know,” falteringly replied the second
looey. “I didn’t get time to study the lesson
today. But, did I understand you to say that the corn
had not been shocked?”</p>

filmy Georgette waists, which are just about as efficient
as chicken wire as far as concealment is concerned.
There is no objection on my part to looking through
them, but do not desire others to have same advantage.
(b) Passing along our main drag the other day,
observed squab with brilliant green stockings.
Promptly remembered General Order No. 2, and followed
it out to best of my ability, when another one
hove in sight with red, white and blue effect on limbs.
Puzzled to know which color to pay attention to in case
it happens again.—<b>Gerry Ed.</b></p>

<p>Indorsements in reply—(a) Would suggest that
you drape your girl in question in heavier attire. (b)
You did perfectly right in observing both sets of stockings,
as your general orders are: “To walk my post in
a military manner, observing everything that takes
place within sight or hearing.”</p>

<p>Husbands are very useful things to have about the
house. Caught young they make useful pets and can
be taught to do a number of tricks. Some husbands are
domesticated and stay at home in the evenings. I
knew one who used to spend every evening at home.
He suffered with gout. Others stay out late and then,
having good friends, they get carried straight in. The
duty of a husband is to touch the cash register and
look pleasant, and so he spent his time trying to live
round a seven by six family on a two by three salary.
Very few husbands ever live any longer than is absolutely
necessary.</p>

<h2><i>Whiz Bang Editorials</i></h2>

<p class="by">“<i>The Bull is Mightier Than the Bullet</i>”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Less than two short years ago the Whiz Bang was
founded, upon my return from the army, on the
Whiz Bang Farm, hoping in so doing that the
veterans and their friends of Robbinsdale and vicinity
would be supplied with samples of the pep and ginger
we had in the army and navy and marine corps. In
our opening number, we expressed a faint hope for
“big time” sometime, and that we could follow in the
footsteps of the Cherry Sisters of vaudeville.</p>

<p>Our hopes and aspirations have been more than
fulfilled. In twenty months, without the aid of advertising
or circulation campaigns, and without a single
subscription agent in the field, we have grown from
3,500 circulation in October, 1919, to more than 300,000
guaranteed paid circulation with this issue, May, 1921.
America surely has given us a grand reception, and
we are grateful. Next month we are planning on letting
our Canadian neighbors get our bundle of farm
filosophy, and as quickly as newsdealers can be communicated
with, we will open up new territory.</p>

<p>Here’s thanks to you, folks, one and all. And we
want you to consider yourself as associate editors. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
you have a story, or a joke, or a question for Captain
Billy to answer, or a verse, or prose, or a catchy saying—send
it in.</p>

<p>And as a grand finale, so to speak, the Whiz Bang
will stay in the fight for the rights of all mankind to
enjoy that liberty—the full measure of our personal
and national liberty—for which we bucked the bean
line in khaki and blue in the recent war. We will
stand firmly opposed to any invasion of our inherent
rights to the pursuit of happiness, health and prosperity.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">The rôle of the drum is anything but hum-drum.
The ear-drum recognizes the sound of a drum
whether the instrument is side, snare, brass or
kettle. In travel I have seen and heard drums big and
little, round, cylindrical, high and low, loud and soft,
wild and weird; played by head, hand and foot—played
fast and slow in life and death, peace and war—played
by savage and by civilized man in the desert or orchestra
hall.</p>

<p>Savages, whose natural argument was a blow on
the head to beat out their enemies’ brains, naturally
fell into a percussion style of music and invented the
drum, often the sole as well as the chief musical instrument.</p>

<p>The drum figures in this world from religion to
ragtime—from the Salvation Army to the jazz band.</p>

<p>Deborah’s timbrel was a sort of drum. The old
tom-tom at an Indian snake-charming doubtless had
its counterpart in Egypt in 1600 B. C., and one listens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to that same noise in modern Cairo. The dull sound
that waked my dreams in the Alhambra was from a
drum the Moor had brought from the East after a
crusade.</p>

<p>Music is a universal language, and the despised,
unmusical drum has a polyglot tongue. All other
musical instruments have their speech of sentiment,
love and emotion, but the voice of the drum knows
the eloquent language of liberty and can get more volunteers
for God, home and native land than all the
orators. The roll of the drum, like that of the sea,
fills the soul’s shore-line and its every bay and gulf.
Heine says that the history of the storming of the
Bastile cannot be correctly understood until we know
how the drumming was done.</p>

<p>The reveille of the drum means that it is time to
get up, and there is a fable of its resurrection meaning
in the old legend of soldiers, fallen in battle, who by
night rose from the grave in the battlefield, and with
drummer at their head, marched back to their native
home.</p>

<p>There is a pathetic story in French history of
Napoleon’s nameless drummer-boy being swept from
the ranks, by the sudden dash of an avalanche, into
an Alpine valley. He was uninjured and the drum
still hung suspended from his neck. He waved his
hands to the soldiers 200 feet above him and began to
drum, playing the tattoo, the reveille, the advance and
the charge. But there was no time to rescue him, the
soldiers passed on, and the last thing they heard in
the clear, cold air was the beat of a funeral march.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Then the little drummer boy lay on the snow bank to
die with the snow for his shroud and the falling night
for his pall. For years the veterans of the Italian
campaign hushed their voices at the campfire, as they
told the story of Napoleon’s drummer-boy, whose slender
body lay frozen beside his drum in the silent solitudes
of the snowy Alps.</p>

<p>In patriotic art we have the spirit of ’76. Germany
has used the drum as a favorite means to raise
recruits—we have done it against her, and by God’s
grace will give her a drum-head court martial before
long, though the world is waiting for the time Tennyson
speaks of, “When the war-drum throbs no longer.”</p>

<p>The drum is the heart-beat of a liberty-loving
humanity. The Fourth of July drum recalls the spirit
of 1917, when Uncle Sam started to make the world
habitable and we prayed that the American eagle
might beat out the brains of Germany’s two-headed
vulture; recalls the spirit of the Spanish War to give
Cuba and the Philippines human rights; recalls the
War of the Rebellion for the union of all creeds, colors
and conditions; recalls the war of Mexico for a square
deal for Americans; recalls the war of 1812 for free
commerce of our ships upon the high seas; recalls the
war of 1776 for liberty by the noble colonists.</p>

<p>I believe in the drum. Can you beat it? Hurrah
for Uncle Sam, the drum-major of the world in the
march for freedom of body, mind and soul, always and
everywhere!</p>

<p class="dropcap">Several persons of our acquaintance have asked
why we refer to marriage in the same sentence
with war. There is no difference.</p>

<p>A fellow meets a girl and decides that she is the
woman he wants to “battle” through life with.</p>

<p>You “present arms” and she “falls in.”</p>

<p>You talk it over and decide on an “engagement.”
At the marriage license bureau you “sign up.” A
minister “swears you in.”</p>

<p>There are only a few “skirmishes” during the
courtship. The real “fighting” starts after marriage.
That’s when a man thinks he’s a “Colonel,” and he’s
only a nut.</p>

<p>In the house, as well as on the “battlefield,” they
use “hand-grenades,” such as flatirons, pots, and rolling
pins.</p>

<p>The wife is usually a good “rifler.” She rifles
your pockets every night, takes your large money, and
“confines you to quarters.”</p>

<p>Whether you have done anything or not, she
always has you on the “mess detail.” She makes her
“counter attacks” in the department stores, and she
knows how to “charge.”</p>

<p>She is your “Commanding Officer,” and you are
her “Supply Officer.”</p>

<p>In the game the fiercest fight is always to come.
Wait until the “infantry” arrives. Instead of “shouldering
arms,” you shoulder the baby. On the battlefields,
shells may screech and scream, but they have
nothing on the kid. You get your “walking papers”
every night. This is the only “hike” you take.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>In war, you sign up for four years. There is no
such clause as that in your wedding certificate. You
can get exemption from war on account of marriage,
but you can’t get exempt from marriage on account
of war.</p>

<div class="verse">And then she went a hustling for work around the town.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
<div class="verse">She’d get up in the morning, go out and get the grub;</div>
<div class="verse">While I lay in my downy bed so humble and so snug.</div>
<div class="verse">But if the day proved gloomy, then in the house we’d stop.</div>
<div class="verse">She’d gather ’round the lay-out while I cooked the fragrant hop.</div>
<div class="verse">When winter drew around at last and things were going fine,</div>
<div class="verse">We had the swellest flat of any couple on the line.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">One night I had a job to do, the richest home in town;</div>
<div class="verse">I got my tools and started out with my pal, Jackie Brown.</div>
<div class="verse">We never thought we’d get a blow, the thing looked like a pipe.</div>
<div class="verse">With all the folks a-sleeping and not a soul in sight,</div>
<div class="verse">We put the goods into a sheet and started down the block.</div>
<div class="verse">And just as luck would have it we bumped into a cop.</div>
<div class="verse">We dropped the swag quick as a flash and started on the run,</div>
<div class="verse">With the copper close behind us, a-shooting off his gun.</div>
<div class="verse">But we were fleet as greyhounds and were halfway down the street,</div>
<div class="verse">When a bullet hit me in the leg and I knew that I was beat.</div>
<div class="verse">The copper stopped to handcuff me while Jackie got away,</div>
<div class="verse">And I never saw his face again for many and many a day.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Well, boys, I know you’ll guess the rest; they made short work of me.</div>
<div class="verse">They sent me up the river to do my little “V.”</div>
<div class="verse">But still I did not worry; I thought my girl would stick</div>
<div class="verse">And keep the flat a-going while I did my little trick;</div>
<div class="verse">I never thought she’d turn me down in 40,000 years;</div>
<div class="verse">But when I think of what came off it almost brings the tears.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">At last the long years passed away and one bright summer day</div>
<div class="verse">I started back to old New York so happy and so gay,</div>
<div class="verse">But when I reached my little flat I found my girl had flown—</div>
<div class="verse">She had run away with Jackie and left me all alone.</div>
<div class="verse">It was then I took to boozing and went from bad to worse;</div>
<div class="verse">I tried to drown my sorrow and forget the bitter curse,</div>
<div class="verse">But the memory of that pretty face was always on my mind,</div>
<div class="verse">So I searched the city over, but no trace of her could find.</div>
<div class="verse">I roamed the streets at leisure seeking vainly for my prey,</div>
<div class="verse">Looking for the man that ruined me and stole my girl away.</div>
<div class="verse">I swore that I’d have his life for the trick that he had done.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">So I searched the country everywhere, knowing well my time would come.</div>
<div class="verse">One day I met a wise guy who knew my pal full well.</div>
<div class="verse">He said he was in ’Frisco and living mighty swell.</div>
<div class="verse">The girl had died in Denver of consumption, so he said,</div>
<div class="verse">Where my former pal had left her to starve from want of bread.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
<div class="verse">It happened at a time, boys, when I didn’t have a cent;</div>
<div class="verse">So I beat my way to Frisco with my mind on vengeance bent.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">One foggy day on Market Street I met him sure as fate;</div>
<div class="verse">He tried to get the drop on me, but was a moment late.</div>
<div class="verse">I sent a bullet crashing into the traitor’s brain,</div>
<div class="verse">And then I made my getaway and “glommed” an eastbound train.</div>
<div class="verse">That’s all there is to tell, boys; I’m like the rest of bums,</div>
<div class="verse">I’ve lost all my ambition and don’t care what becomes—</div>
<div class="verse">And as he finished talking, from his hip he drew a gun.</div>
<div class="verse">In a moment came a sharp report—his grafting days were done.</div>

<div class="verse">Of “Just Kiss Me, Doc, and Burn All My Clothes,”</div>
<div class="verse">They would clinch and grapple in vise-like embrace,</div>
<div class="verse">And he’d plant his “map” up the side of her face.</div>
<div class="verse">With his right “lunch-hook” her waist he’d entwine,</div>
<div class="verse">You’d almost think he was massaging her spine.</div>
<div class="verse">And thus clamped together they would trot and trip</div>

<h2><i>Budd’s Bundle of Bunk</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="by">BY BUDD L. McKILLIPS</p>

<p class="center"><i>Author of “After the Raid”</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">This talk of blue laws gets my goat; reformers
make me sore. I’d like to take them by the throat
and kick them through the door. Time was I used
to drink some beer, and maybe sing a song—perhaps
I got soused once a year, and didn’t think it wrong.</p>

<p>But now if I desire a drink, some basement I must
find, and if I get by with a wink perhaps I may go
blind. The beer I drank was harmless stuff, ’twas
made of hops and grain; the hootch today is made of
snuff, ground glass and paint and rain.</p>

<p>Three weeks ago I took a drink—just one, I took
no more; if I had two I really think I’d whipped an
army corps. The one I took was bad enough, it stood
me on my neck, and then I started to get rough and
made the place a wreck. Somebody called three
policemen in, they sat upon my brow and kicked me
underneath the chin—I’ve got the marks there now. A
riot call brought out more troops who battered me with
clubs, then locked me in the city coops with ninety
other dubs.</p>

<p>My friends chipped in and paid my fine of thirty
thousand bucks, the doctors patched my head and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
spine—that cost five hundred shucks. When I got well
my friends I told I’d never drink again, but soon I
caught a beastly cold that filled my soul with pain. In
olden days I’d hit the hay with half a pint of “Crow”
and sure as fate in half a day the cold was sure to go.</p>

<p>This time I hunted up a doc and told him of my
ills. His heart was harder than a rock—he gave me
quinine pills. I took the pills to the lagoon and fed
them to the ducks, then bought a quart of fresh-made
“moon” that cost me seven bucks.</p>

<p>That night in bed I took a shot to drive the cold
away; I woke up in a vacant lot at 10 a. m. next day.</p>

<p>From now on henceforth I am through with booze
that makes me fight with elephants of vivid hue, and
sleep in trees at night. No more I’ll sample raisin
“skee” that causes much turmoil. I’ll take a chance
on T. N. T., bay rum or croton oil.</p>

<p>There’s not much fun in life because there’s
naught but woe and pain that’s come from passing
foolish laws—I guess I’ll go to Spain.</p>

<h2><i>Musings of a Bachelor</i></h2>

</div>

<div class="smaller">

<p class="dropcap">There are three kinds of females—foolish girls, damphoolish
girls and married women.</p>

<p>Strong perfume has never yet become an excuse for not
bathing.</p>

<p>When a man becomes so well acquainted with a girl that she
tells him “Now, stop,” he is fairly well acquainted.</p>

<p>Most men have quit wearing suspenders, but that’s about all
some women wear.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways to kiss a girl, but only one way to
kiss a married woman.</p>

<p>A girl with a quart of hootch is more popular these days than
the girl with a ton of good looks.</p>

<p>Telephone girls who say over the wire “Numbah, please,” are
the same ones who at home shout “Hey, pass them spuds.”</p>

<p>Long ago I was taught that “All is not gold that glitters,” and
more recently I have found out that all who flap are not flappers.</p>

<p>Girls who live in glass houses should always pull down the
shades.</p>

<p>Girls with highly polished finger nails are generally the ones
with runs in silk hosiery.</p>

<p>When women get their heads together and whisper, they’re
talking about some other woman; when men do the same they’re
discussing the latest recipe for home-made hootch.</p>

<p>A woman who will faint at the sight of a mouse will tell you
that the prize fight she saw was very tame.</p>

<p>A friend of mine wanted to buy a vamp table. I didn’t know
what a vamp table was. He said it was a table with straight legs
and without anything on top.</p>

<p>There are some girls who, at a theater, insist upon whispering
to their escort that “the man on the other side is trying to flirt with
me.”</p>

<p>Chewing tobacco seems to have passed out with booze and suspenders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
A real “man” nowadays wears a belt and a wrist watch
and smokes pills.</p>

<p>Somebody has said recently that jazz music is the voice of the
devil. But who the devil cares?</p>

<p>When a woman threatens to scream you can be sure she won’t.</p>

<p>An optimist is a member of the bartenders’ union who is still
paying dues.</p>

<p>There are some married women who would like to play football
providing there weren’t any goal posts.</p>

<p>A boxer who fights his battles in the ring instead of in the columns
of the newspapers is a sufficient attraction these days to merit
considerable attention.</p>

<p>A young woman tries to please man. When she gets old she
tries to please God.</p>

<p>It’s a long way from Los Angeles to Palm Beach but the styles
in bathing suits of the Mack Sennett queens and the dames of high
society seem about the same.</p>

<p>Electric lights were never made for courting. In the days of the
gas jet a fellow could turn down the light a little at a time. Now he
has to snap off the electricity all at once and take a chance.</p>

<p>There may be a good many arguments against the restoration of
the good old four per cent beer, but right now we can’t think of a
single one.</p>

<p>There were more divorces, more murders, more burglaries in
New York in 1920 than in 1919. Hooray for prohibition!</p>

<p>As we remember the arguments of the prohibitionists a dry
country would be nothing short of Utopia. There wasn’t going to be
any crime nor any marital difficulties nor were any young girls
going to go wrong. It is a merry world, my masters.</p>

<p>It costs so much nowadays to get a house to live in and enough
booze for the house warming that there isn’t anything left for
furniture.</p>

<h3>Those Dreadful Drummers</h3>

<p>Four or five jolly drummers gathered in the smoking
compartment of a Pullman car, and soon their
conversation drifted to the great problem of the day—women.
In the party also was a frock-coated pastor
of serious mien.</p>

<p>The salesmen winked at each other as the minister
entered, and then, as if to have some harmless pleasure,
one after another started telling of the wonderful virtues
of the knights of the grip.</p>

<p>“I am often away from home for four weeks at
a time,” one salesman commenced, “and I never even
look at another woman.”</p>

<p>“And I am so bound up in the charms of my wife
that I’m ashamed to tip the check girls,” declared the
next one.</p>

<p>“Why, my wife is so good to me that I won’t allow
a woman to wait on me in a restaurant,” said another.</p>

<p>Their conversation sounded too much like unadulterated
bunk for the good minister to swallow, and he
joined the party by offering a silk hat to any salesman
present who could truthfully say he had always been
faithful to his wife. The pastor won his point and
the conversation soon drifted to other subjects.</p>

<p>The next day one of the salesmen arrived home
and soon told his wife of the jolly party in the Pullman
smoker.</p>

<p>“But, John,” she said, “why didn’t you take him
up?” John’s active salesman brain worked quickly.</p>

<p>“Why, Mable, you know I look like hell in a silk
hat.”</p>

<h3>You Can’t Fool ’em at Tall</h3>

<p>He had been married about six months, during
which time he had made the most strenuous endeavors
to abandon his former naughty ways and to give up
his intemperate bachelor friends and the numerous
pretty ladies with whom he had so long been associated.
But it happened one day that he fell in with
a very dear friend, till in a somewhat dazed condition
he eventually fetched up at his “home sweet” ’round
about five o’clock on the following morning. Stealthily
he crept upstairs to bed and wifie being, as he
imagined, asleep, equally stealthily did he start to
undress in the cold, gray light of dawn. For a time
all went well; then suddenly a voice rose above the
stillness:</p>

<p>“Charles, where’s your vest?”</p>

<p>Charles pulled himself together rapidly and
endeavored to review the situation.</p>

<p>“My dear,” he replied confidentially, after much
mental effort, “upon my soul, I believe I must have
left it—in the cab!”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
